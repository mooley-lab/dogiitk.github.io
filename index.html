Dog aggression (associated with dog bites, bike accidents etc)<br>
Dogs occupying spaces that they should not (e.g. workplace, hostel rooms)<br>
At some places the problem is really bad (e.g. lane 32, Hostel 4)<br>
Security or campus authorities will not help despite repeated pleas<br>
Students threaten to file an FIR if any action is initiated against dogs (esp. in hostels)<br>

Did you know? Dog bite cases are very frequent in the IITK campus. Although institute authorities have not released the precise data to us, we know from reliable sources in the HC that there are at least 2 dog bite cases per week. Sometime within the past 2 years, there was 1 month when 100+ dog bite cases were reported. This is substantially larger than many other places in Kanpur.

These points were discussed by the diligent team on campus. The minutes of this meeting can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rZgviF_ujbYuVaSDQDO7BwvXmnIlY_BO/view?usp=drive_link">HERE</a>.

“I am ABC, a PhD student, currently residing in Hall 4, A-XYZ. I am having constant issues with
a dog named Dolly (identified by its white and brown fur). The dog enters my room and refuses to leave. It growls at anyone trying to move it. This is killing my time and spoils my day, rendering the day useless and frustrating. I wanted to internally transfer to C-XYZ, a room I am quite familiar with, due to my friend. I have been constantly requesting for the same since the past few days and also mentioned my intention for the same to the hall office, and even tried to contact the hall president. I am yet to see any resolution from their end regarding the transfer.
Can you please help me in this issue? It would be great if you can give me the permission to internally transfer to C-XYZ.”

<ul>
<li> There should be a human welfare cell on campus</li>
<li> Dogs could be adopted by dog-lovers on campus. </li>
<li>A special case can be legally requested since we have academic area, residential areas etc in the same campus</li>
<li>Placards could be placed across campus saying that we are not supposed to feed dogs (else they may get aggressive)</li>
<li>Need to investigate all factors (food, territory etc) that make dogs aggressive and the need for promptly addressing aggressors on campus</li>
<li>Control dog population on campus: excess dogs should be removed from campus. Fencing could be placed across forest areas to prevent more stray dogs from entering the campus.</li>

  </div>

<center>
A stray dog that roams around lanes 21-24, brutally attacked a new-born kitten and disemboweled it in July 2024. It attacked the mother cat as well but the mother being an adult, was able to escape. Her kitten was not so fortunate. The kitten received immediate medical attention thanks to compassionate campus residents but died within a week. It is notable that this particular stray dog is extremely well-fed, to the point of being almost cared-for by campus residents. For the past two years that I have been living on lane 21, I have witnessed numerous incidents of unprovoked violence by dogs against cats, often nursing and pregnant cats.
<br><br>
Stray dogs are also often violent towards other dogs, especially the weaker ones. My late mother, in the last months of her life, developed a certain amount affection towards a stray dog that roams around lanes 21-24 who is extremely docile. It seems the dog used to be a human pet and was abandoned at some point since it seems to have been toilet trained. It pained my mother to often see that dog presenting with bite and scratch marks. That dog presented with wanderlust tendencies and we found no way to convince it to not approach the lanes with aggressive dogs.
Dogs are instinctive hunters and their immersion in an environment that is not suitable for hunting is bound to cause friction. For example, even pet owners are advised to not have large hunting breeds as pets unless one is able to offer sufficient outlets to satiate their hunting instincts, say via tussles with toys, fetching etc.
